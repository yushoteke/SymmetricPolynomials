    ways_place_containers(x,m)

Given containers of sizes x, and m balls, enumerate all the ways to place the balls
into the containers without violating the constraints.

Lets illustrate this function through an example. Suppose we want to find
all the ways to place 4 balls into 4 containers with capacities [2,1,3,4]

We define f(m,e) as the number of solutions of placing m balls into the
e leftmost containers. Then we could build a table, vertically m and horizontally e.

The base cases are
m  e|   1   2   3   4
--------------------------
0   |   1   1   1   1
1   |   1
2   |   1
3   |   0
4   |   0

And then we could fill in the rest of the table using the recursive formula
f(m,e)=âˆ‘f(m-i,e-1)  where i=0:min(m,c[e]), where c[e] is the capacity of the e^th container.

m  e|   1   2   3   4
--------------------------
0   |   1   1   1   1
1   |   1   2   3   4
2   |   1   2   5   9
3   |   0   1   6   15
4   |   0   0   5   20

Then we could use this table to build the actual solutions with another builder function.
